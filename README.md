# finalproject_ee8603
This project encompasses the application of advanced regression techniques to analyze a bike-sharing dataset, aiming to predict the count of bikes shared based on various environmental and temporal factors. Two distinct modeling approaches were employed: one utilizing the PyCaret library for machine learning and the other leveraging the capabilities of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The PyCaret model involved time series cross-validation to assess its predictive performance, while the RNN and LSTM models were specifically structured to capture the sequential and time-dependent nature of the dataset. The final outcomes of the project indicate a robust performance of the models in predicting bike-sharing patterns, effectively encapsulating the complex interactions of multiple categorical and numerical variables that influence bike-sharing behavior. The project demonstrates the efficacy of these advanced modeling techniques in interpreting and forecasting patterns in transportation and urban mobility datasets. â€‹
